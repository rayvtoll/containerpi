# containerdesktop
The main container around the VCDE stack (Github rayvtoll/vcde).

If you would like to see this container in action, please visit https://github.com/rayvtoll/vcde and follow instructions.

This container has a Windows Look & Feel but runs Linux LXDE with a different window manager (Metacity). 
You can access the container desktop in a browser. It is using the Guacamole protocol to do so. 
Some applications (LibreOffice and Firefox) are additional containers that will launch automatically if needed and are displayed by forwarding X through SSH.
